This error indicates a broken or closed (disconnected) powershell session,
it occurs mostly in Pester's teardown (MergeLogs / msi uninstallation)
and sometimes during setup. Perhaps it matters, perhaps it doesn't.
It's possible that it occurs only under high load
(most of the errors occured on 2018-07-17 and 2018-07-18).

Why we recheck it: As it may occur in various places, there's no
good place to retry it.
