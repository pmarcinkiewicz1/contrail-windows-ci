# (-ErrorAction SilentlyContinue). However, this is not acceptable for
# template creation (we don't want to have unreliable template).

# Workaround (#1) for Docker/Windows behavior.
# When WinNAT is enabled and NetNat object associated with default bridge
# network created by Docker exists, ICMP/UDP packets bigger than MTU do
# not reach containers and the host itself.
# Workaround (#2) for win_service behavior.
# We use win_shell instead of win_service because for this particular service
# win_service seems to fail ("An error occurred while creating the pipeline")
# while it works fine for other services like Docker.
